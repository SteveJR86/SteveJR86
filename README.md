## About Me

I'm a front end web developer who has recently completed an edX bootcamp and is now looking to collaborate on projects to make the web an exciting and accessible place for all.

I've worked on both Vanilla and React based projects and am looking to develop my React knowledge further this coming year.

I'm currently working on a website for a local business and also a third party analysis tool for a blockchain based property trading game.

Outside of coding I enjoy running, walks in the countryside and spending time with my young family.

If you want to contact me to discuss any of my repo's, potential jobs or collaborations feel free to pop me an email at [steven.j.riley@gmail.com](mailto:steven.j.riley@gmail.com)
